# mqt Demo Document

Welcome to the mqt demonstration document. This file contains various Markdown elements to showcase mqt's querying capabilities.

## Getting Started

mqt is a powerful TUI for querying Markdown documents. Use the `:` key to enter query mode and start exploring.

### Basic Queries

Here are some queries you can try:

- `.h` - Select all headings
- `.link` - Select all links
- `.code` - Select all code blocks
- `.list` - Select all lists

## Code Examples

### JavaScript Example

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
  return true;
}

greet("World");
```

### Python Example

```python
def calculate_sum(numbers):
    """Calculate the sum of a list of numbers."""
    return sum(numbers)

result = calculate_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
print(f"Sum: {result}")
```

### Rust Example

```rust
fn fibonacci(n: u32) -> u32 {
    match n {
        0 => 0,
        1 => 1,
        _ => fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2),
    }
}

fn main() {
    println!("Fibonacci(10) = {}", fibonacci(10));
}
```

## Lists and Tasks

### Shopping List

- Apples
- Bananas
- Oranges

   - Second level item 1
   - Second level item 2
     - Third level item
2. Another first level
   - More nested items
3. Final item

## Blockquotes

> "The best way to predict the future is to invent it."
> - Alan Kay

> **Note:** mqt supports real-time query execution as you type.

> **Tip:** Use the tree view mode to visualize your document structure.

## Mathematical Expressions

Inline math: $E = mc^2$

Block math:

$$
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
$$

## Horizontal Rules

Here are some sections separated by horizontal rules:

## Advanced Features

### Custom Filtering

You can use complex filters with mqt:

```mq
.h | select(.depth >= 2 and .depth <= 3)
.code | select(.lang == "rust")
.link | select(.url | contains("github"))
```

### Tree Visualization

Press `t` to see the document structure as a tree with color-coded elements:

- Headings (Blue)
- Lists (Green)
- Math (Red)
- Links (Magenta)
- Images (Yellow)
- Code blocks (Cyan)

## Conclusion

This demo document covers the main Markdown elements that mqt can query and manipulate. Try different queries to explore the power of mqt!

### Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Open this demo
mqt assets/demo.md

# Open any Markdown file
mqt README.md

# Installation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harehare/mqt/main/bin/install.sh | bash
```

### Next Steps

1. Try query mode with `:` key
2. Explore tree view with `t` key
3. View details with `d` key
4. Copy results with `y` key
5. Check help with `?` key
